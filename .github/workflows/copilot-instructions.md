This is a fork of the original repository.

I am maintaining this fork to implement new features and improvements.

This is a library for AdonisJS that automatically generates Swagger documentation for your API routes.

Changes here are tested on a separate codebase using AdonisJS. So when I post a screen shot, it will be from that codebase.

This repo is linked globally on my machine so I can use it locally and see changes as I build in real-time in my adonisjs project.

Also I am using pnpm not npm
